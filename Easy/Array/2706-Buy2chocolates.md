# 2706. Buy Two Chocolates

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @param {number} money
 * @return {number}
 */
var buyChoco = function(prices, money) {
 let min1 = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;;
 let min2 = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;;

    for(let p of prices){
        if(p<min1){
            min2=min1;
            min1=p;
        }else if(p<min2){
            min2=p;
        }
    }
    let leftover = money-min1-min2;
    if(leftover>=0){
    return leftover;
    }
    else
    {
    return money;
    }
};
```

The usage of `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` in this context is a common practice in JavaScript algorithms to represent a value that is greater than any other numeric value. Here's how it applies in this scenario:

1. **Initialization of `min1` and `min2`**: 
   - `min1` and `min2` are initialized to `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. This ensures that any price encountered in the `prices` array will be smaller than these initial values during the comparison process. This initialization is crucial because it guarantees that the loop will update `min1` and `min2` with actual prices from the array.

2. **Comparisons during the Loop**:
   - Inside the loop, prices are compared against `min1` and `min2`. Initially, since `min1` and `min2` are set to infinity, any price encountered will be smaller, and thus they will be updated accordingly.

3. **Effect of Infinity**:
   - By using `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, we ensure that the loop will correctly update `min1` and `min2` to the smallest and second smallest prices in the `prices` array, respectively. This is because any valid price encountered in the array will be less than infinity.

4. **Final Calculation of `leftover`**:
   - After finding the smallest and second smallest prices (`min1` and `min2`), the code calculates the `leftover` money by subtracting these prices from the initial `money`.
   - If `leftover` is non-negative, it means the purchase is possible, and it is returned as the result.
   - If `leftover` is negative, it means it's not possible to buy two chocolates without going into debt. In this case, `money` is returned to signify this situation.

Using `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` ensures correct initialization and comparison of prices, making the algorithm robust and able to handle edge cases where prices might be very low or negative. It's a way to ensure correctness and maintainability in the code.
