# 349. Intersection of Two Arrays

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]

Output: [2]



Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]

Output: [9,4]

Explanation: [4,9] are in common.

To solve the "Intersection of Two Arrays" problem using a hash table (also known as an object in JavaScript), you can follow a straightforward approach. This method involves iterating through one of the arrays and using the elements as keys in a hash table. Then, you iterate through the second array, checking if each element exists as a key in the hash table. If it does, you add it to the result array. This approach ensures that each element in the result array is unique and is an intersection of the two input arrays.

Here's how you can implement it:

```javascript
function intersection(nums1, nums2) {
    let hash = {};
    let result = [];

    // Iterate through nums1 and add each element as a key in the hash table
    for (let num of nums1) {
        hash[num] = true;
    }

    // Iterate through nums2 and check if each element exists in the hash table
    for (let num of nums2) {
        if (hash[num]) {
            // If the element exists, add it to the result array
            result.push(num);
            // Remove the element from the hash table to ensure uniqueness
            hash[num] = false;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

This function works as follows:

- It initializes an empty object `hash` to act as a hash table.
- It iterates over `nums1` and adds each element as a key in the `hash` object with a value of `true`. This step is crucial for quickly checking if an element exists in the hash table.
- It then iterates over `nums2`. For each element in `nums2`, it checks if the element exists as a key in the `hash` object. If it does, it means the element is common to both arrays, so it is added to the `result` array.
- To ensure that each element in the `result` array is unique, it sets the value of the key in the `hash` object to `false` after adding the element to the `result` array. This way, if the same element appears again in `nums2`, it won't be added to the `result` array because its value in the `hash` object is `false`.
- Finally, it returns the `result` array, which contains the intersection of `nums1` and `nums2`.

This solution is efficient because it only requires two passes through the arrays and uses a hash table for quick lookups, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
